# gpu-monitor
A basic gpu-monitoring utility for NVIDIA GPUs

gpu-monitor is a simplistic layer on top of nvidia-smi which returns a .csv formatted file containing GPU utilisation, temperature, fan speed and power usage over a given time interval.

Usage is rather self explanatory, see the argparser for usage flags. (to be written up later)

The intended use of gpu-monitor is for internal cluster monitoring within Oxford@SBCB, however if you find this useful and want this to be fleshed out do let me know.
